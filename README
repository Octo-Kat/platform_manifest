REAL AOSP + GPE + OctSettings = OctOS

~~~~~!!!!!TEACHING TIME!!!!!~~~~~
Pull up a chair and prepare to learn.

Setup Your Environment in Ubuntu/Linux:
--------------------------------------
    http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2368833
You can alternatively install everything manually.  Click below for more information:
    http://lmgtfy.com/?q=setup+android+environment

Downloading the Source(about 30-40GB of files):
----------------------------------------------
    * Make your project directory =>     "mkdir ~/oct"
    * Navigate or change directory to your project directory =>    "cd ~/oct"
    * Initialize the project =>   "repo init -u git://github.com/Octo-Kat/platform_manifest -b kk-4.4"
    * Sync the project files to your machine =>    "repo sync"

-OR- 
    String all the commands together using &&:
    * "mkdir ~/oct && cd ~/oct && repo init -u git://github.com/Octo-Kat/platform_manifest -b kk-4.4 && repo sync"

Building a supported device using lunch:
---------------------------------------
    * ". build/envsetup.sh"
    * "lunch"
    * "make otapackage"

-OR- 
    ". build/envsetup.sh && lunch"
    "make otapackage -j__"
    (where __ is put however many cores you can dedicate to the build MINUS one, quad core is -j3, octo core -j7, etc etc)

* Your initial build will take about anywhere from 2-6 hours.  Each build after will take between 20-40 minutes.

Building using our jet optimization:
------------------------------
    * "jet/DEVICE.sh n #"
    Where DEVICE is replace it with a supported device like "jfltevzw" and where # is replace it with your -j(cores) number(just the number). For example this will build a Galaxy s4 for Verizon at 3 cores:
    "jet/jfltevzw.sh n 3"
-~-~-~-~-~->NOTE<-~-~-~-~-~-
the jet script was designed to help us build more efficiently.  The n in the string means do not push to our website/ota.  If you replace it with y it means yes push to the website.  You however will not have the credentials to push to the website.  The n command also will push the build to our copy folder.  You wont have that permission either.  So at the end of your build it will have a small error saying unable to copy to such and such folder.  This is normal and perfectly fine.

Thanks for playing!
